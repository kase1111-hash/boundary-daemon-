# Placeholder for encrypted startup program data
#
# When the StartupMonitor is initialized, it will create an encrypted file here:
#   ~/.local/share/boundary-daemon/.startup_programs.enc
#
# The file contains:
# - List of known startup programs
# - Encrypted with machine-specific key
# - HMAC integrity verification
#
# Run the GUI or CLI to initialize:
#   python -m daemon.security.antivirus_gui
#   python daemon/security/antivirus.py --startup-init
